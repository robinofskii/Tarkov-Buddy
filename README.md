# What's this project all about

Well, in my time playing Escape from Tarkov, I've ran into a lot of things where I was like: "I wish I had a better interface for that." or "Should I keep this item for a quest or hideout?"

These, I think, are questions in the mind of every new Tarkov player. And yes, I know there are a lot of other tools on the internet that will help with quests, hideout management, armor and ammo datasheets etc. But there will always be features to add or improve. Plus, maybe like some other developers, I like doing it myself.
